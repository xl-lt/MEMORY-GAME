# MEMORY-GAME
Hi this is Najah aka xl-lt,
Iâ€™m currently Learning js 

I have created this project to show some of the skills I have learned till know in js.

 This is a memory game written in JS, HTML and  CSS. The goal is to match pairs of cards in the least number of matching attempts.


This game code  was written & compiled using VSC.

Plz enjoy my game:)
